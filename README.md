Welcome to tutorial 19!  This file is displayed by GitHub by default
when you visit the repository, as you can see.

GitHub supports Markdown (a variant called "GitHub-flavored", specifically)
for formatting of this file - I'll cover that in the bonus lecture on
TeX, if you don't know it.

Making a second edit here just for the history - you'll revert this later!
